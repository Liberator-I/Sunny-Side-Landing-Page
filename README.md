## My Process

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Javascript

## A few Notes:
- Not built responsive for all screen sizes.
- Project only built to work on normal 1080p monitor and mobile phones in portrait mode
- Goal was to see if I had the necessary skills to build a landing page from scratch and add a bit of Javascript for the menu toggle
